# Background Context
Embark on an exciting journey to understand and implement locomotion techniques in virtual reality (VR). This project involves a deep dive into different types of VR locomotion, causes of VR motion sickness, and methods to minimize it. Furthermore, you’ll learn to implement a teleportation method of movement and design interactive objects within the VR environment.

Remember, this project requires a VR headset for testing. You may use Google Cardboard, Oculus, HTC Vive, or any other VR device of your preference. Also, it’s important to note that different headsets and Software Development Kits (SDKs) have different requirements and capabilities. Therefore, you’re encouraged to leverage relevant documentation and tutorials for your specific hardware setup.

# Technical Description
## This project focuses on the following key areas:

- Understanding VR Locomotion: Dive deep into the types of locomotion/movement in VR and understand their implications on user experience.
- XR Interaction Toolkit: Learn Unity’s built in package for XR Input and interactions.
- VR Motion Sickness: Understand what causes VR motion sickness and how to minimize its effects in your VR implementations.
- Implementing Teleportation in VR: Learn and implement one of the most popular VR movement techniques - teleportation.
- Creating Interactive Objects in VR: Get hands-on with creating interactive objects within your VR environment, enhancing the user experience.
- You’re expected to use the most recent version of Unity LTS for this project. Unity 2021-2023 is adequate for this project.

*Note: You’re not required to upload your applications to the App Store or Play Store if targeting iOS or Android devices. But, you will be required to submit a working build/executable for your targeted device. *

## Core:

- XR Interaction Toolkit
- The Science of Locomotion in VR
- Movement in VR
- Game Design Deep Dive: Making VR movement feel like a superpower

## Suggested:

- Unity Manual: Introduction to VR Best Practices - Read all sections
- Why AR/VR developers should prioritize accessibility in UI / UX Design

## Complimentary:

- UI / UX in AR / VR
- Unity Manual: Understanding optimization in Unity

# What you should learn
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What are the different types of locomotion / movement in VR
- What causes VR motion sickness
- What are the different methods of minimizing VR motion sickness in locomotion implementations
- How to implement a teleportation method of movement in VR
- How to implement interactive objects in VR

# Requirements for Unity projects
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your unity-vr_room directory

- This project should be uploaded to its own repo named unity-vr_room
- Scenes and project assets such as Scripts must be organized as described in the tasks
- In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
- In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
